# Eclipse Xtext

This branch tracks the websites [xtext.org](http://xtext.org) and [xtend-lang.org](http://xtend-lang.org). For general information about Xtext, see the [master branch](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext).

The [website-published](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/tree/website-published) branch corresponds to what is published on the actual websites. Fixes that should be made visible immediately must be committed there. The [website-master](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/tree/website-master) branch is used to write documentation and release notes for the next major or minor release of Xtext.
