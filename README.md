# Xtext

Xtext is a framework for development of programming languages and domain specific languages. It covers all aspects of a complete language infrastructure, from parsers, over linker, compiler or interpreter to fully-blown top-notch IDE integration for Eclipse, IntelliJ and Web-based IDEs. It comes with great defaults for all these aspects, which at the same time can be easily tailored to your individual needs.
