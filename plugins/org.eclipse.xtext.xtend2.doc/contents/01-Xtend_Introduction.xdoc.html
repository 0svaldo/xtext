<p>
This document specifies the language Xtend. Xtend is a modern statically-typed programming language which is
tightly integrated with and runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It has its roots in the Java programming
language but improves on a couple of concepts:   
</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Advanced Type Inference - You rarely need to write down type signatures
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Full support for Java Generics - Including all conformance and conversion rules
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Closures - concise syntax for anonymous function literals
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Operator overloading - make your libraries even more expressive
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Powerful switch expressions - type based switching with implicit casts
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
No statements - Everything is an expression
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
First class support for template syntax, with intelligent whitespace handling
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
injected extension methods - Enhance closed types with new functionality injected via JSR-330
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
property access syntax - shorthands for getter and setter access
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
multiple dispatch aka polymorphic method invocation
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
translates to Java not bytecode - understand what&apos;s going on and use your code for platforms such as Android or GWT
</p>

</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
It is not aiming at replacing Java all together but meant to be used to write Guice-injected component implementations. Therefore its library is just a 
thin layer over the Java Development Kit (JDK) and interacts with Java exactly the same as it interacts with Xtend code. Also Java can call Xtend functions 
complete transparent way. 
And of course, it provides a modern Eclipse-based IDE closely integrated with the Java Development Tools (JDT).
