h1(#MWE2). MWE2

The Modeling Workflow Engine 2 (MWE2) is a rewritten backwards 
compatible implementation of the Modeling Workflow Engine (MWE). It 
is a declarative, externally configurable generator engine. Users 
can describe arbitrary object compositions by means of a simple, 
concise syntax that allows to declare object instances, attribute 
values and references. One use case - that's where the name had its 
origins - is the definition of workflows. Such a workflow consists 
usually of a number of components that interact with each other. 
There are components to read EMF resources, to perform 
operations (transformations) on them and to write them back or to generate 
any number of other artifacts out of the information. Workflows are 
typically executed in a single JVM. However there are no constraints 
the prevent implementors to provide components that spawn multiple 
threads or new processes.

h2(#MWE2Exampe). Examples

Let's start with a couple of examples to demonstrate some usage 
scenarios for MWE2. The first examples is a simple _HelloWorld_ 
module that does nothing but print a message to standard out. The 
second module is assembled of three components that read an Ecore 
file, transform the contained classifier-names to upper-case and 
serialize the resource back to a new file. The last examples uses 
the life-cycle methods to print the execution time of the workflow.

h3(#MWE2HelloWorld). The Simplest Workflow

The arguably shortest MWE2 module may look like the following 
snippet.

bc.. module HelloWorld 

SayHello {
  message = "Hello World!"
}
p. It configures a very simple workflow component with a message 
that should be printed to _System.out_ when the workflow is 
executed. The module begins with a declaration of its name. It must 
fulfill the Java conventions for fully qualified class-names. That's 
why the module _HelloWorld_ has to be placed into the default 
package of a Java source folder. The second element in the module is 
the class-name _SayHello_ which introduces the root element of the 
module. The interpreter will create an instance of the given 
type and configure it as declared between the curly braces. E.g. the 
assignment _message = "Hello World!"_ in the module will be 
interpreted as an invocation of the _setMessage(String)_ on the 
instantiated object. As one can easily imagine, the implementation 
of the class _SayHello_ looks straight forward:

bc.. import org.eclipse.emf.mwe2.runtime.workflow.IWorkflowComponent;
import org.eclipse.emf.mwe2.runtime.workflow.IWorkflowContext;

public class SayHello implements IWorkflowComponent {

  private String message = "Hello World!";
  public void setMessage(String message) {
    this.message = message;
  }
  public String getMessage() {
    return message;
  }

  public void invoke(IWorkflowContext ctx) {
    System.out.println(getMessage());
  }

  public void postInvoke() {}
  public void preInvoke() {}
}
p. It looks like a simple POJO and that's the philosophy behind MWE2. 
It is easily possible to assemble completely independent objects in 
a declarative manner. To make the workflow executable with the 
_WorkflowRunner_, the component _SayHello_ must be nested in a root 
workflow:

bc.. module HelloWorld 

Workflow {
	component = SayHello {
		message = "Hello World!"
	}
}
p. The class _Workflow_ is actually 
_org.eclipse.emf.mwe2.runtime.workflow.Workflow_ but its package is 
implicitly imported in MWE2 modules to make the the modules more 
concise. The execution result of this workflow will be revealed 
after a quick _Run As .. -> MWE2 Workflow_ in the console as 

bc.. Hello World!
h3(#MWE2SimpleTransformation). A Simple Transformation

The following workflow solves the exemplary task to rename every _EClassifier_ in an _*.ecore_ file.
It consists of three components that read, modify and write the model file:

bc.. module Renamer
Workflow {
  component = ResourceReader {
        uri = "model.ecore"
  }
  component = RenamingTransformer {}
  component = ResourceWriter {
        uri = "uppercaseModel.ecore"
  }
}
p. The implementation of these components is surprisingly simple. It is easily possible to create
own components even for minor operations to automate a process.

p. The _ResourceReader_ simply reads the file with the given _URI_ and stores it in a so called
_slot_ of the workflow context. A slot can be understood as a dictionary or map-entry.

bc.. public class ResourceReader extends WorkflowComponentWithSlot {
  private String uri;
  public void invoke(IWorkflowContext ctx) {
    ResourceSet resourceSet = new ResourceSetImpl();
    URI fileURI = URI.createFileURI(uri); 
    Resource resource = resourceSet.getResource(fileURI, true);
    ctx.put(getSlot(), resource);
  }
	
  public void setUri(String uri) {
    this.uri = uri;
  }
  public String getUri() {
    return uri;
  }
}
p. The actual transformer takes the model from the slot and modifies it. It simply iterates the content
of the resource, identifies each _EClassifier_ and sets its name. 

bc.. public class RenamingTransformer extends WorkflowComponentWithSlot {
  private boolean toLowerCase = false;
  public void invoke(IWorkflowContext ctx) {
    Resource resource = (Resource) ctx.get(getSlot());
    EcoreUtil.resolveAll(resource);
    Iterator<Object> contents = EcoreUtil.getAllContents(resource, true);
    Iterator<EClassifier> iter = 
        Iterators.filter(contents, EClassifier.class);
    while(iter.hasNext()) {
      EClassifier classifier = (EClassifier) iter.next();
      classifier.setName(isToLowerCase() 
          ? classifier.getName().toLowerCase()
          : classifier.getName().toUpperCase());
    }
  }

  public void setToLowerCase(boolean toLowerCase) {
    this.toLowerCase = toLowerCase;
  }
  public boolean isToLowerCase() {
    return toLowerCase;
  }
}
p. After the model has been modified it should be written to a new file. That's what the 
_ResourceWriter_ does. It actually takes the resource from the given _slot_ and saves it with
the configured _URI_:

bc.. public class ResourceWriter extends WorkflowComponentWithSlot {
  private String uri;
  public void invoke(IWorkflowContext ctx) {
    Resource resource = (Resource) ctx.get(getSlot());
    URI uri = URI.createFileURI(getUri());
    uri = resource.getResourceSet().getURIConverter().normalize(uri);
    resource.setURI(uri);
    try {
      resource.save(null);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      throw new WrappedException(e);
    }
  }

  public void setUri(String uri) {
    this.uri = uri;
  }
  public String getUri() {
    return uri;
  }
}
p. Last but not least, the common super-type for those components looks like this:

bc.. public abstract class WorkflowComponentWithSlot 
      implements IWorkflowComponent {
  private String slot = "model";
  public void setSlot(String slot) {
    this.slot = slot;
  }
  public String getSlot() {
    return slot;
  }
	
  public void postInvoke() {}
  public void preInvoke() {}
}
p. Each of the mentioned implementations is rather simple and can be done in a couple of minutes. 
This is true for many tedious tasks that developers face in their daily work. MWE2 can be used to
automize these tasks with minimum effort.

h3(#MWE2Stopwatch). A Stopwatch

The last example demonstrates how to combine the MWE2 concepts to create a simple stopwatch that
allows to measure the execution time of a set of components. The idea is to add the very same stopwatch
twice as a component to a workflow. It will measure the time from the first pre-invoke to the last
post-invoke event and print the elapsed milliseconds to the console.

bc.. public class StopWatch implements IWorkflowComponent {
  private long start;
  private boolean shouldStop = false;
  public void invoke(IWorkflowContext ctx) {}

  public void postInvoke() {
    if (shouldStop) {
      long elapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
      System.out.println("Time elapsed: " + elapsed + " ms");
    }
    shouldStop = true;
  }

  public void preInvoke() {
    start = System.currentTimeMillis();
  }
}
p. Clients who want to leverage this kind of stopwatch may use the following pattern. The stopwatch-instance 
will be added as the first component and the last component to a workflow. Everything in between will
be measured. In this case, it is another workflow that does not need know about this decoration. The idea
is to use a local identifier for the instantiated _StopWatch_ and reuse this one at the end to receive
the post-invoke life-cycle event twice. 

bc.. module MeasuredWorkflow

Workflow {
  component = StopWatch: stopWatch {}
  component = @OtherWorkflow {}
  component = stopWatch
}

h2(#MWE2LanguageReference). Language Reference

MWE2 has a few well defined concepts which can be combined to 
assemble arbitrary object graphs in a compact and declarative 
manner.

* A MWE2 file defines a _module_ which exposes its root _component_ as reusable artifact.
* _Properties_ can be used to extract reusable, configurable parts of the workflow.
* Components are mapped to plain vanilla _Java objects_. Arbitrary _set- and add-methods_ are used to configure them.

Let's consider the follow short example module and _SampleClass_ to 
explain these concepts.

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

import java.util.*

SampleClass {
  singleValue = 'a string'
  multiValue = ArrayList {}
  child = {}
} 

bc.. package com.mycompany;

import java.util.List;

public class SampleClass {
  public void setSingleValue(String value) {..}
  public void addMultiValue(List<?> value) {..}
  public void addChild(SampleClass value) {..}
}

h3(#MWE2JavaReferences). Mapping to Java Classes

p. The module _com.mycompany.Example_ defines a root component of 
type _com.mycompany.SampleClass_. It is possible to use the simple 
class-name because MWE2 uses the very same visibility rules as the 
Java compiler. Classes that are in the same package as the module 
can be referenced by their simple name. The same rule applies for 
classes from the _java.lang_ package. For convenience reasons is the 
package _org.eclipse.emf.mwe2.runtime.workflow_ implicitly imported 
as well as it exposes some library workflow components. However, the
imports are more flexible then in Java since MWE2-imports can be relative, e.g. 
the _import java.*_ resolves the reference _util.ArrayList_ to 
_java.util.ArrayList_.  

p. The root instance of type _SampleClass_ has to be configured 
after it has been created. Therefore the method _setSingleValue_ 
will be called at first. The given parameter is 
_'a string'_. The method is identified by its name which starts with 
_set_. To allow to assign multi-value properties, MWE provides 
access to methods called _add*_ as well. 

p. If the right side of the assignment in the workflow file does not 
define a class explicitly, its type is inferred from the method 
parameter. The line _child = {}_ is equivalent to 
_child = SampleClass {}_ and creates a new instance of _SampleClass_.

p. MWE2 ships with nice tool support. The editor will provide 
content assist for the allowed types and highlight incompatible 
assignments. The available properties for Java classes will be 
proposed as well.

h3(#MWE2Module). Module 

As MWE2 modules have a fully qualified name, it is possible to refer
to them from other modules. The type of the module is derived from
the type of its root component. The _com.mycompany.Example_ can be
assigned at any place where a _com.mycompany.SampleClass_ is expected.

p. Let's create a second module _com.mycompany.Second_ like this:

bc.. module com.mycompany.sub.Second

import com.mycompany.*

SampleClass {
  child = @Example {}
} 
p. The _child_ value will be assigned to an instance of _SampleClass_ 
that is configured as in the first example workflow. This enables
nice composition and a very focused, reusable component design. 

p. As the same rules apply in MWE2 like in Java, the module 
_com.mycompany.sub.Second_ has to be defined in a file called 
_Second.mwe2_ in the package _com.mycompany.sub_. The import semantic
for other modules is the same as for classes. The import statement
allows to refer to _com.mycompany.Example_ with a shortened name.

h3(#MWE2Properties). Properties

MWE2 allows to extract arbitrary information into properties to 
ensure that these pieces are not cluttered around the workflow and 
to allow for easier external customization. The exemplary component 
definition was only changed slightly by introducing a property 
_value_.

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

var value = 'a string'

SampleClass {
  singleValue = value
}
p. The type of the property will be derived from the default value 
similar to the mechanism that is already known from _set_- and 
_add_-methods. If no default value is given, _java.lang.String_ will
be assumed. However, properties are not limited to strings. The 
second built in type is boolean via the familiar literals _true_ and
_false_. More flexibility is available via actual component literals.

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

var childInstance = SampleClass {
                      singleValue = "child"
                    }

SampleClass {
  child = childInstance
}
p. If one wants to define string properties that are actual reusable
parts for other properties, she may use defined variables inside other
literals like this: 

bc.. var aString = "part"
var anotherString = "reuse the ${part} here"
p. This is especially useful for file paths in workflows as one would
usually want to define some common root directories only ones in the
workflow and reuse this fragment across certain other file locations.

h3(#MWE2Mandatory). Mandatory Properties

It is not always feasible to define default values for properties. 
That is where mandatory properties come into play. Modules define their
interface not only via their fully qualified name and the type of the
root component but also by means of the defined properties.    

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

var optional = 'a string'
var mandatory

SampleClass {
  singleValue = optional
  child = {
    singleValue = mandatory
  }
}
p. This version of the example module exposes two externally assignable
properties. The second one has no default value assigned and is 
thereby considered to be mandatory. The mandatory value must be assigned
if we reuse _org.mycompany.Example_ in another module like this:

bc.. module com.mycompany.Second

var newMandatory

@Example {
  mandatory = "mandatoryValue"
  optional = newMandatory
} 
p. Note that it is even possible to reuse another module as the root
component of a new module. In this case we set the mandatory 
property of _Example_ to a specific constant value while the previously
optional value is now redefined as mandatory by means of a new property
without a default value.

p. It is not only possible to define mandatory properties for MWE2 
modules but for classes as well. Therefore MWE2 ships with the 
_@Mandatory_ annotation. If a _set_- or _add_-method is marked as
_mandatory_, the module validation will fail if no value was assigned
to that feature.

h3(#MWE2NamedComponents). Named Components

Properties are not the only way to define something that can be reused.
It is possible to assign a name to any instantiated component whether it's
created from a class literal or from another component. This allows
to refer to previously created and configured instances. Named instances
can come handy for notification and call-back mechanisms or more general
in terms of defined life-cycle events. 

p. If we wanted to assign the created instance to a property of itself,
we could use the following syntax:

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

SampleClass : self {
  child = self
}
p. A named component can be referenced immediately after its creation but
it is not possible to define forward references in a MWE2 file.

h3(#MWE2AutoInject). Auto Injection

Existing modules or classes often expose a set of properties that 
will be assigned to features of its root component or set- and add- 
methods respectively. In many cases its quite hard to come up with 
yet another name for the very same concept which leads to the situation
where the properties itself have the very same name as the component's
feature. To avoid the overall repetition of assignments, MWE2 offers
the possibility to use the _auto-inject_ modifier on the component 
literal:

bc.. module com.mycompany.Example

var child = SampleClass {}

SampleClass auto-inject {
}
p. This example will implicitly assign the value of the property
_child_ to the feature _child_ of the root component. This is especially
useful for highly configurable workflows that expose dozens of optional
parameters each of which can be assigned to one or more components.

p. The _auto-inject_ modifier can be used for a subset of the available
features as well. It will suppressed for the explicitly set values
of a component.        

h2(#MWE2SyntaxReference). Syntax Reference

The following chapter serves as a reference for the concrete syntax of 
MWE2. The building blocks of a module will be described in a few words.

MWE2 is not sensitive to white-space and allows to define line-comments
and block comments everywhere. The syntax is the same as one is used 
to from the Java language:

bc.. // This is a comment
/* 
  This is another one.
*/
p. Every name in MWE2 can be a fully qualified identifier and must follow 
the Java conventions. However, in contrast to Java identifiers it is 
not allowed to use German umlauts or Unicode escape sequences in 
identifiers. A valid ID-segment in MWE2 starts with a letter or an 
underscore and is followed by any number of letters, numbers or underscores.
An identifier is composed from one or more segments which are delimited
by a '.' dot.

bc.. Name: ID ('.' ID)*;
ID: ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9')*; 
p. MWE2 does not use a semicolon as statement delimiter at any place.
 
h3(#MWE2ModuleSyntax). Module

p. !{width:50%}images/mwe2/module.png!

A _module_ consists of four parts. The very first statement in a 
_*.mwe2_ file is the module declaration. The name of the module must 
follow the naming convention for Java classes. That MWE2 file's name 
must therefore be the same as the last segment of the module-name 
and it has to be placed in the appropriate package of a Java source 
path.

p. It is allowed to define any number of import statements in a module.
Imports are either suffixed by a wild-card or concrete for a class 
or module. MWE2 can handle relative imports in case one uses the 
wild-card notation:

bc.. 'import' name '.*'?   

h3(#MWE2PropertySyntax). Property

p. The list of declared properties follows the optional import section.
It is allowed to define modules without any properties. 

p. !{width:50%}images/mwe2/property.png!

p. Each declared property is locally visible in the module. It 
furthermore defines an assignable feature of the module in case one 
refers to it from another module. Properties may either have a 
default value or they are considered to be mandatory. If the type
of property is omitted it will be inferred from the default value. The
default type of a property is _java.lang.String_ so if no default
value is available, the property is mandatory and of type _String_.

p. There are four types of values available in MWE2. One may either
define a string, boolean or component literal or a reference to a
previously defined property. 

h3(#MWE2ComponentSyntax). Component

The last part of a module is the root component. It defines the externally
visible type of the module and may either be created from a Java 
type or from another module.

p. !{width:50%}images/mwe2/component.png!

p. The type of the component can be derived in many cases except for 
the root component. That's why it's optional in the component literal.
If no type is given, it will be inferred from the left side of the
assignment. The assigned feature can either be a declared property
of the module or a _set_- or _add_-method of a Java class.

p. Components can be named to make them referable in subsequent assignments.
Following the _':'_ keyword, one can define an identifier for the 
instantiated component. The identifier is locally visible in the module
and any assignment that is defined after the named component can refer
to this identifier and thereby point to exactly the instantiated object.

p. The next option for a component is _auto-inject_. If this modifier
is set on a component, any available feature of the component that has
the same name as a property or previously created named component will
be automatically assigned.

p. The core of a component is the list of assignments between the curly 
braces. An arbitrary number of values can be set on the component by
means of feature-to-value pairs. 

p. !{width:50%}images/mwe2/assignment.png! 

p. The available constructs on the right hand side of the assignment
are the same as for default values for properties. 

h3(#MWE2StringLiteralsSyntax). String Literals

String values are likely to be the most used literals in MWE2. There 
is a convenient syntax for string concatenation available due to
the high relevance in a description object composition and configuration 
language. MWE2 strings are multi-line strings and can be composed of
several parts.

bc.. var aString = 'a value'
var anotherString = 'It is possible to embed ${aString} into
 a multi-line string'
p. This is especially convenient for path-substitution if one defines
e.g. a common root directory and wants to specify other paths relative
to the base. 

p. There are two different delimiters available for strings. Users 
are free to either use single- or double-quotes to start and end strings. 
If a certain string contains a lot of single-quotes one would better
choose double-quotes as delimiter and vice versa. There is no semantic 
difference between both notations.

p. The escape character in MWE2 is the back-slash _"\"_. It can be used
to write line-breaks or tabular characters explicitly and to escape
the beginning of substitution variables _${_ and the quotes itself. Allowed
escape sequences are:

bc.. \n  .. line break
\r  .. carriage return
\t  .. tabular character
\'  .. single-quote (can be omitted in double-quoted strings)
\"  .. double-quote (can be omitted in single-quoted strings)
\${ .. escape the substitution variable start ${
\\  .. the back-slash itself
p. Other escape sequence are illegal in MWE2 strings.
  
h3(#MWE2BooleanLiterals). Boolean Literals

MWE2 has native support for the boolean type. The literals are _true_ and _false_.

h3(#MWE2References). References

Each assigned value in MWE2 either as default for properties or in a
component assignment can be a reference to a previously declared property
or named component. The can be referenced intuitively by their name.
