h1. IDE concepts

For the following part we will refer to a concrete example grammar in order to explain certain aspect 
of the UI more clearly. The used example grammar is as follows:

bc.. grammar org.eclipse.text.documentation.Sample 
    with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate gen 'http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/documentation/Sample'

Model :
  "model" intAttribute=INT (stringDescription=STRING)? "{" 
     (rules += AbstractRule)* 
  "}" 
;

AbstractRule:
  RuleA | RuleB
;

RuleA :
   "RuleA" "(" name = ID ")" ;

RuleB return gen::CustomType:
   "RuleB" "(" ruleA = [RuleA] ")" ;
