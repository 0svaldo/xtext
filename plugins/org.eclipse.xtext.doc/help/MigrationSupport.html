<p>In this document we tried to explain why we decided to change some aspects of Xtext&rsquo;s architecture. We consider most changes as minor but when it comes to scopes you will face a conceptual enhancement that did not exist in oAW Xtext. We tried to explain why it is not easily possible to come up with an adapter for scoping.</p>
<p>That said you might not have the time to do the migration and wished to have advice for migrating, especially from oAW linking to TMF linking. You&rsquo;re welcome to ask any questions in the newsgroup and we&rsquo;ll try to help you as much as possible in order to get your projects migrated. Also, if you don&rsquo;t want to do the migration yourself we (itemis AG) can do the work for you or help you with that. </p>
