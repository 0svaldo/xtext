<p>Although a couple of things have changed we tried to keep good ideas and left many things unchanged. At the same time we wanted to clean up poor concepts and solve the main problems we and you had with oAW Xtext.
				From a bird&rsquo;s eye view if you want to migrate an existing oAW Xtext project to TMF Xtext, you mainly just need to rename the old grammar from *.xtxt to *.xtext and add two lines to the beginning of that document (see below for details). You might also have to change a few keywords, but all in all this is pretty easy and we&rsquo;ve migrated a couple of oAW Xtext projects this way without problems.
				The other aspect where lots of code might have been written for is validation. In oAW Xtext we used Xpand&rsquo;s Check language to define constraints on the Ecore model. Even though this has been one major reason for the lack of scalability in Xtext we decided to keep the Check language as an option for compatibility reasons. Therefore, you do not need to translate your existing checks to a different language. Even better, you can overcome some performance issues by leveraging the newly introduced hooks to control the time of validation (while you type, on save, or on triggering an explicit action). 
				Anyway, if you want to provide a slick user experience validation should run fast while you type. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to implement validation using our 
				<a class="link" href="validation.html#custom_validation" title="Custom Validation">declarative Java approach</a>.
			</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve developed and reviewed a lot of oAW Xtext projects and saw that most of the work was done in the grammar and in the validation view point. 
				Other aspects such as outline view, label provider or content assist have been customized too, but they usually do not contain complicated Xtend code.
				In some projects the exception was linking and content assist which in oAW Xtext usually forces one to write a lot of duplicated code. While working on this we came up with a new concept called &ldquo;scopes&rdquo; that not only streamlines implementation in terms of redundancy. Scopes also increase the overall performance of Xtext.
				But since the concept of scopes was not carved out in oAW Xtext one usually implemented a cluttered and duplicated poor copy through linking and content assist. For obvious reasons, we didn&rsquo;t manage to come up with a good compatibility layer.
				So this is where most of the migration effort will go into if implemented customized linking. But we think the notion of scopes is such a valuable addition that it is worth the refactoring. Also, when looking at existing oAW Xtext projects we found that most projects either didn&rsquo;t change the default linking that much or they came up with their own linking framework anyway.</p>
<p>However, if we have completely misunderstood the situation and your oAW Xtext project cannot be migrated in a reasonable amount of time, please tell us. We want to help you!</p>
