<p>Xtext provides you with a set of domain-specific languages and modern APIs to describe the different aspects of your programming language. 
				Based on that information it gives you a full implementation of that language running on the JVM. The compiler part can be used in any Java environment 
				and includes such things as parser, AST, parse tree, serializer, formatter, scoping framework, linking, compiler checks aka validation and last but not least a 
				code generator or interpreter. The runtime components integrate with and implement the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which effectively allows you to 
				use Xtext together with other EMF frameworks like for instance the Graphical Modeling Project.</p>
<p>In addition to this nice runtime architecture, you will get a full blown Eclipse-IDE specific for your language. It already provides great default functionality for 
				all aspects and again comes with DSLs and APIs to let you configure or change the most common things very easily. And if that&rsquo;s not flexible enough there is Guice.</p>
