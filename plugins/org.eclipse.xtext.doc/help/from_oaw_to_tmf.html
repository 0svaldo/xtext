<p>TMF Xtext is a complete rewrite of the Xtext framework previously released with openArchitectureWare 4.3.1 (oAW). We refer to the version from oAW as oAW Xtext.
			oAW Xtext has been around for about 2 years before TMF Xtext was released in June 2009 and has been used by many people to develop little languages and corresponding Eclipse-based IDE support.</p>
<p>This document describes the differences between oAW Xtext and TMF Xtext and is intended to be used as a guide to migrate from oAW Xtext to TMF Xtext.
			For people already familiar with the concepts of oAW Xtext it should also serves as a shortcut to learn TMF Xtext.  </p>

<p>The first thing you might wonder about is why we decided to reimplement the framework from scratch as opposed to use the existing code base and enhance it further on. 
				We decided so because we had learned a lot of lessons from oAW Xtext and wanted to stick with many proven concepts 
				but found the implementation to lack a solid foundation (the author of these lines is the original author of that non-solid code btw. :-)). The first version of oAW Xtext was just a proof of concept
				and was so well received that it had been extended with all kinds of features (some were good, some were bad). Unfortunately code quality, clean and orthogonal concepts and test coverage had not the needed focus.</p>
<p>In addition to this general lack of code quality, oAW Xtext suffers from some severe performance problems. The naive use of Xtend (see next section) made use of bigger models in Xtext editors unusable.</p>
